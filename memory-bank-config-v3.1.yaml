      I notice we may need to refresh context about this project. Let me review the Memory Bank files:
      
      From productContext.md:
      [Key project information]
      
      From activeContext.md:
      [Current focus and state]

## 8. Memory Reset Resilience Rules
reset_resilience:
  detection_rules:
    - "If questions are asked about information already in Memory Bank files, assume memory reset occurred"
    - "If contradictions arise between statements and Memory Bank content, prioritize Memory Bank"
    - "If terminology or project-specific terms are suddenly not recognized, assume memory reset"
    - "If basic context about the current task is lost, assume memory reset"
    - "If previous conversation references are not understood, assume memory reset"
  
  recovery_directives:
    - "On detected reset, immediately execute reading sequence starting with productContext.md"
    - "Generate a context summary using the context_summary template"
    - "Explicitly reference most recent Memory Bank updates with file names and timestamps"
    - "Quote directly from Memory Bank files when providing critical context information"
    - "Begin responses with explicit statements connecting to Memory Bank content"
    - "Use the context_loss_detected response template when reset is detected"
    - "For complex tasks, revalidate current understanding before continuing implementation"

  memory_retention_patterns:
    - "Update activeContext.md with explicit continuation points at task boundaries"
    - "Create hierarchical summaries (project-level, component-level, task-level)"
    - "Document key decisions immediately when made, don't defer documentation"
    - "Cross-reference all related information with explicit file paths and section names"
    - "Use standardized section headers consistently across Memory Bank files"
    - "Add descriptive metadata at tops of files (purpose, relationship to other files)"
    - "Create semantic anchors ([component-name], [decision-id]) for precise references"
    - "When transitioning topics, explicitly save current context to activeContext.md"

  prompt_optimizations:
    - "Focus on memorable, unique project details that assist in context reactivation"
    - "Use consistent terminology dictionary across all Memory Bank files"
    - "Create memorable relationship models for system components (analogies, patterns)"
    - "Prioritize specificity over generality in all Memory Bank entries"
    - "Add context identifiers to session boundaries (session-2025-03-01-1)"
    - "Include explicit relationship markers between concepts ('X depends on Y')"
    - "Create redundant context paths (multiple ways to reach the same information)"

## 9. Contextual Instructions
contextual_directives:
  general:
    - "Always prefix responses with Memory Bank status for immediate context awareness"
    - "Link every new file or concept to at least one existing Memory Bank document"
    - "Present multiple complete commands as single-line sequences for easier execution"
    - "Before implementation, verify architectural alignment with systemPatterns.md"
    - "Decompose complex tasks into sequential steps with explicit dependencies"
  
  error_handling:
    - "When errors occur, document them in activeContext.md before attempting fixes"
    - "For recurring errors, create dedicated troubleshooting entries in systemPatterns.md"
    - "Prioritize debugging documentation over immediate fixes for complex issues"
    - "When fixing bugs, always update both code and related documentation simultaneously"
    - "Create explicit test cases for verified bug fixes in progress.md"

  workflow_optimization:
    - "Minimize mode switching by batching similar tasks together"
    - "Complete Memory Bank updates before switching modes"
    - "Keep task scope narrowly defined and self-contained"
    - "Include expected outputs and verification steps with each task"
    - "Establish clear completion criteria before beginning implementation"

## 10. Collaboration and Consistency Framework
collaboration_framework:
  multi_developer_rules:
    - "Begin each session with 'git pull' to ensure Memory Bank is current"
    - "Document developer handoffs explicitly in activeContext.md"
    - "Always sign decision entries with developer identifier in decisionLog.md"
    - "Update content_map.md when adding any new files to Memory Bank"
    - "Maintain changelog section in progress.md with date-stamped entries"
  
  session_boundary_protocols:
    session_start:
      - "Always check for Memory Bank existence first"
      - "Read core files in sequence: productContext.md > systemPatterns.md > activeContext.md > progress.md"
      - "Verify task dependencies are met before continuing suspended work"
      - "Present summary of current status from activeContext.md"
      - "List available next tasks from progress.md in priority order"
    
    session_end:
      - "Execute UMB command before ending significant sessions"
      - "Document incomplete work with explicit resumption points"
      - "Record all open questions that arose during the session"
      - "Update task status for all touched tasks"
      - "Provide clear continuation path for next session"
  
  consistency_enforcement:
    - "Apply systemPatterns.md conventions without exception"
    - "Reject implementation that contradicts documented patterns"
    - "Maintain identical formatting and structure across related files"
    - "Enforce naming conventions uniformly across all new files"
    - "Flag pattern deviations as architectural issues requiring resolution"

## 11. Performance and Scalability Rules
performance_rules:
  memory_bank_optimization:
    - "Keep individual files under 2000 lines for faster processing"
    - "Implement hierarchical organization for projects with >20 Memory Bank files"
    - "Use linked documents rather than duplicating large blocks of content"
    - "Archive completed milestone documentation to maintain active file focus"
    - "Create dedicated index files for sections with >10 related documents"
  
  large_project_directives:
    - "Segment documentation by domain/module with consistent prefixing"
    - "Implement strict naming convention enforcement for all Memory Bank files"
    - "Create explicit content_map.md entries for each project component"
    - "Use progressive disclosure pattern for complex architectural documentation"
    - "Maintain separate task lists for each major project component"
  
  response_time_optimization:
    - "Prioritize Memory Bank file updates that affect current context"
    - "Batch documentation updates for related changes"
    - "Use standardized templates to minimize formatting overhead"
    - "Reference existing patterns rather than recreating documentation"
    - "Structure documentation to minimize context switching between modes"

## 12. System Integration 
integration_rules:
  git_integration:
    - "Include Memory Bank in version control with .gitignore exceptions for sensitive data"
    - "Document branch relationships in decisionLog.md when working across branches"
    - "Update Memory Bank before and after significant merges"
    - "Document git workflow decisions in systemPatterns.md"
    - "Note commit hashes for important implementation milestones"
  
  ci_cd_integration:
    - "Document build process requirements in productContext.md"
    - "Reference CI/CD configuration in systemPatterns.md"
    - "Update task status based on CI/CD pipeline results"
    - "Maintain test coverage expectations in systemPatterns.md"
    - "Document deployment procedures and environments"
  
  third_party_tooling:
    - "Document API integration patterns in systemPatterns.md"
    - "Maintain credentials management protocols (without storing actual credentials)"
    - "Document required environment variables and configuration"
    - "Track third-party dependency decisions in decisionLog.md"
    - "Document testing strategies for external integrations"

## 13. Advanced Operations
advanced:
  autonomous_task_execution:
    code:
      - "Can work through clearly defined tasks in Memory Bank autonomously"
      - "Must ensure all dependencies for a task are met before starting"
      - "Pre-Task: Read all relevant files to understand scope completely"
      - "Implementation: Only implement what is specified in current task scope"
      - "Post-Task: Verify implementation matches scope exactly and update task status"
      - "If task scope is unclear, request clarification before writing code"
  
  multi_project_handling:
    detection: "Scan workspace for memory-bank/ directories"
    selection: "Prompt user to choose project when multiple Memory Banks found"
    organization:
      - "Keep Memory Banks at project roots"
      - "Use descriptive project names"
      - "Clearly separate project directories"
